Change log for shapes-oo-scala project

- Uncommented test fixtures and boundingBox tests in TestFixtures.scala and TestBoundingBox.scala.
- Implemented new behaviours:
  * boundingBox (with accurate ellipse handling and empty group case, logging)
  * size (counts leaf shapes, logging)
  * height (computes shape tree height, logging)
  * scale (recursively scales dimensions, logging)
- Added logging support:
  * Added scala-logging and logback dependencies in build.sbt.
  * Configured logback.xml with INFO root level and DEBUG for shapes package.
  * Behaviours extend StrictLogging and emit debug/info messages.
- Added constructor validation in Shape enum cases using require calls.
- Added validation tests in TestValidation.scala to exercise constructor checks.
- Created TestSize, TestHeight, and TestScale classes with appropriate tests.
- Added README.md summarizing features, usage, and extra credit notes.
- Adjusted boundingBox rules for ellipses and empty groups.
- Updated tests and fixtures accordingly.
- Converted all code to Scala 3 significant-indentation syntax and added compiler options (scalaVersion and scalacOptions) in build.sbt.
